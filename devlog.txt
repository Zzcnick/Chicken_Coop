NOTE - pardon lack of devlogging before this point, not much has really happened
other than the design doc and the creation of skeleton files
* wrote ctos(card c) - returns a string representing a Set card (from the given
  card struct's attrs) including color ANSI escape code before and white ANSI
  escape code after

* wrote populate(deck * d) - takes pointer to struct deck and populates with 81
  cards, so that for every attribute exactly a third of the deck has one of the
  three possible values (thus every card is a unique combination of attributes)
* wrote print_card() and print_deck()

* provide alternate solution to printing cards without ctos
* restructure some code in board.h
* ensure deck creation is working
