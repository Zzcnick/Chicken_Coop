NOTE - pardon lack of devlogging before this point, not much has really happened
other than the design doc and the creation of skeleton files
* wrote ctos(card c) - returns a string representing a Set card (from the given
  card struct's attrs) including color ANSI escape code before and white ANSI
  escape code after

* wrote populate(deck * d) - takes pointer to struct deck and populates with 81
  cards, so that for every attribute exactly a third of the deck has one of the
  three possible values (thus every card is a unique combination of attributes)
* wrote print_card() and print_deck()

* provide alternate solution to printing cards without ctos
* restructure some code in board.h
* ensure deck creation is working

zichengZ -- 2017-01-12 22:09
* add deck shuffling

zichengZ -- 2017-01-13 10:54
* begin work on displaying the board
* create board struct

* Most of Phase I working, meaning
   * The way deal(deck * d) works now is that the struct deck has two pointers,
     one being the index past which all the cards have been dealt, and the other
     being the index past which all the cards have been removed. deal(deck * d)
     shifts the former to the left by 3 given that there are fewer than 21 cards on
     the table already (if there are more, the function returns -1) and that there
     are still cards left to be dealt (if there aren't, the function returns 1).
     If the operation is successful, the function returns 0.
   * remove_card has been replaced with remove_set, which takes a pointer to a
     deck and three integer indices. The cards with these indices are swapped
     with three cards at the end of the section of cards that have been dealt
     but not removed. The removed pointer is then decremented.
   * display(deck d) has been added, print_deck(deck) has been removed.
   * check_attr(void *a, void *b, void *c) and check_set(card c1, card c2, card c3)
     have been added. check_set(...) returns 0 if the cards don't make a set.
   * set_exists(deck d) has been rewritten, since the struct board has been
     removed
   * set.c now has the function parse(deck * d, char *input) which takes a str
     in the form "A1 B2 C0" and either "BOOYAH!"s and removes the set or
     is condescending if the user's input is not a set.
   * The main function uses fgets to get the user's preferred username, and to
     get the user's input once the game starts. For each iteration cards are
     dealt if the number of cards on the table is less than 9 (the deal function
     won't do anything if there are not enough cards to do this) and also if
     there are no sets on the table. The user's input gets parsed unless the
     user enters "exit," in which case the program is terminated.
* For Single Player to be complete we still need a timing and a scoring
  mechanism.
* I haven't tested all the way to the end of a game so I haven't tested for
  end-of-game cases.
WOOOO SO MUCH PROGRESS OMG!!!!!

- facts @ SO MUCH PROGRESS! 
- add some quality of life improvements
  - add helper function to remove void * warnings
  - change shape to a char * to remove void * warnings
  - add terminal clearing

- begin work on networking
- start skeleton files

- OKAY OKAY KNOCKING ON WOOD BUT I THINK SINGLE PLAYER IS DONE
- So here is how highscore.c works now:
   - the struct playerscore is essentially a node in a linked list, with the
     expected freeing and insertion functions.
   - print_scores takes a filename (I've added the empty file h.txt for this)
     and simply prints it out
   - write_scores takes a playerscore linked list and a filename and overwrites
     the given file with the linked list's info
   - read_scores takes a filename and turns the info in the given file into a
     playerscore list, which it returns
- So in Single Player, the way scores get recorded is:
   - a playerscore list is initialized as read_scores("h.txt")
   - the new user and newly calculated score are inserted into this list
   - h.txt is overwritten with this list using write_scores
   - the score rankings are printed using print_scores on h.txt
   - slight modifications can be made in order to print up to 5 top scorers
WOOOOOOOOOO PROGRESSSS

- Complete networking framework and create setserver for implementation
  - Use select to solicit input from stdin and server on both sides
  - Verify connection between server and client exists on localhost
- Begin implementation of setserver into set client
